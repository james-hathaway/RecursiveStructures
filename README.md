# RecursiveStructures
Credit to @https://www.youtube.com/@EmergentGarden (@MaxRobinsonTheGreat) for the original code. Modifications were made from the GPT output to create more complex structures for my own enjoyment.

The effort put in was minimal, as EmergentGarden wrote the code himself, but it was really fun to play around with any I encourage those who see this to both try it out yourself and support EmergentGarden on YouTube!
